# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .Net Framework.

<h2>Projects:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Blackjack Game</li>
<li>Car Insurance</li>
<li>News Letter App</li>
</ul>

<h2>BlackJack Game</h2>
<p>Created a game for users to create a username and play Blackjack against the dealer. I have added exceptions to catch if user entered a negative amount and not to only allow correct characters used in responses.</p>

<h2>Car Insurance</h2>
<p>A simple MVC app to allow users to obtain a car quote based on their driving history. It takes user's input and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an Admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>

<h2>News Letter</h2>
<p>This project allows users to signup to receive frequent news letters. There is also an admin page for staff to view users signed up and has the ability to remove users at their discretion.</p>
